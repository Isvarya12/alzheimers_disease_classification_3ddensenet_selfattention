# Brain MRI Image Classification using 3D DenseNet121 and Self Attention

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file  that demonstrates the process of classifying brain MRI images into Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Cognitive Normal (CN), and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using a 3D DenseNet121 architecture with self-attention mechanism. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras

You can install these libraries using the following:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

## Dataset

The ADNI dataset is used for training and testing the model. Please download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory. You can download the ADNI dataset from [ADNI's official website](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/).

## Running the Notebook

1. Download the ADNI dataset and organize it in a directory.
2. Open the `ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially.

Happy coding!
